
Program Start

Initialize unitName to "".
Initialize Scanner class variable.
Create a studentMarks array of size 25.
Initialize marks, highest marks, lowest marks, sum, mean and standard deviation to 0.
Take unitName from User.
Take student marks from user.
Repeat steps until the length of student marks.
	if user enters valid marks
		save the marks at the specific index in the student marks arrays.
	Else promts the user to enter valid marks.
Run for loop until the length of student marks array	
	assign the first varibale of student marks array to highest and lowest marks.
	if the value of student marks array at the i index is greater than the value stored in highestt marks
		assign the value to the highest marks
	if the value of student marks array at the i index is less than the value stored in lowest marks
		assign the value to the lowest marks
	add the value of student array in the sum variable
End For Loop
Divide the sum by the length of student marks array and store it in the mean varible
Run For Loop until the length of student array
	find the power of student array variables and cummulatively store it in a local variable named res.
End For Loop	
Divide the res value by length of student marks array 
Find the standard deviation by taking square root.
